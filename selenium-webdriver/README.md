The various folders contain different tests and tools.

#test1

Tried combination of selenium webdriver and JUnit. The tests simply open the page and assert the title is correct.

#test2

Maven-based test using webdriver's ExpectedCondition and Javascript injection.

#test3

Maven-based testing of a Data Element's value and whether a Page Load Rule has fired.

#CatalogWebsiteDataElementsAndRulesFired

A Java tool that, given a list of URLs will create a JSON file with all Data Element values it found plus all Page Load Rules that fired on each page.

The list of URLs must be provided in a file called "urls_all_pages.txt", one URL per line.

The JSON output will be in a file called "pageInfo.json".

#testJSONEdit

A single-page HTML tool for changing the JSON file created by CatalogWebsiteDataElementsAndRulesFired

You can enable and disable the "active" flag on Data Elements and Page Load Rules per page.

The idea is to use the result of this for automated tests.

#TestDEsAndPLRsOnSite

A Maven- and selenium-based test.

Takes a JSON file generated by "testJSONEdit" and tests all pages, Data Elements, and Page Load Rules as defined in the file.
